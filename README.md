# nestedstacks
Set of 1 parent stack with 3 nested stacks (rds, skeleton, app/ec2)

This template creates:
- 1 VPC
- Bastion host (in autoscaling group)
- Autoscaling group with apache servers (2 AZ's, 2 private subnets)
- NAT gateway
- RDS cluster
- ELB

Considerations:
In this setup the RDS stack is a nested stack. If any change with the other stacks goes wrong you could easily corrupt your data. If you're using this setup for production it's wise to create a seperate rds stack and use the import/export-values functionality instead. If anything goes wrong you'll at least still have your unharmed database stack. 

No nACL's are configured. Please do so when using this template for any form of production environment!
